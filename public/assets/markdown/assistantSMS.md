#### Assistant for Scrap Mechanic Survival

---

I had really been enjoying playing around with Flutter and had decided to set up a template for a future project I had in mind. It was going to be a website and mobile app with one code base written in Flutter. I got the project working but it felt pointless since the game I was writing it for was only going to be released in a year, so I decided to test my template skills on Scrap Mechanic, to see how long it would take me to get a working app and website. It took me about 2 weeks to get the apps onto the App Stores and hosted on [scrapassistant.com](https://scrapassistant.com).

This project is also the first Flutter app that is completely open source. [![Open Source](/assets/img/fileIcons/view_on_github.png)](https://github.com/AssistantSMS)

This app also benefitted from using the [AssistantApps Flutter.Common](https://github.com/AssistantApps/Flutter.Common) Dart library. This helped speed up the development because a lot of the components were already built and systems like localization was ready to use from the beginning.
