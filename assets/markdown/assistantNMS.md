### Assistant for No Man's Sky

---

During a few days while my home internet connection was down, I picked up the game No Manâ€™s Sky again. While playing I was frustrated with the crafting mechanics of the game and how it expected the player to remember over 1200 different items and crafting recipes. I had not played the game in several years and could barely remember the controls, so crafting, refining and other recipes was completely out of the question ðŸ˜….

I wanted an app that would allow me to get those recipes as easily and fast as possible. There was one app on the Google Play Store, however a lot of its functionality was behind a pay wall. I then decided to build my own version using Flutter. 

&nbsp;

The apps are build with Flutter and Dart, this was my first major app built with Flutter and so the project structure and code within were quite messy. Over time I found time and motivation to do some massive refactoring. The project structure is at a point that (in my opinion) is good. A lot of the common functionality has also been extracted to the [AssistantApps Flutter.Common](https://github.com/AssistantApps/Flutter.Common) Dart library so that other [AssistantApps](https://assistantapps.com) can benefit from the logic.

As of August 2020 (1 year later) the apps have reached 45 000 active users! ðŸŽ‰
