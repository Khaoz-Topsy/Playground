### AssistantApps

---

After starting the 3rd Assistant for _XYZ_ app I felt that it was time to create a group for all the apps to belong to. AssistantApps was the most logical in my mind at the time but is probably not the best in terms of SEO ðŸ˜…. Around this time I also moved common logic from the apps into a seperate Dart package so that the logic could be reused. I also created an AssistantApps API to share common back-end logic such as fetching the list of current Patreons.

This group of apps has expanded a bit with the addition of [patreonbanner.com](https://patreonbanner.com)
